-- DISCORD BOT --

--04/09/2021 PATCH--

A simple info command was put into the bot, to acess it, just type $info.
Bugs resolution.

What can the sussy bot do ? (besides being sus):

-Send (reply) hello messages to the users
-Send curiositys
-Send memes
-Send videos
-Send news channels
-Send help messages

But it's restricted to say only certain memes or videos ?

The awnser is no !

You can update the bot with whatever you want, sharing some other inputs with other users

For now, it's possible to update

Welcome messages
Curiosities
Memes
Vmemes (meme videos)

I'll bring other updates after, but for now, I'll just maintain this ones.
